<h1>For M2 Read If you can't test!</h1>
<a> PHP and SQL Integration
PHP Backend:
I implemented the backend using PHP with a custom structure, opting not to rely on traditional stacks like XAMPP. Instead, I used PHP’s built‑in server to serve and process PHP files. Being on macOS, I wanted to experiment with setting up each tool manually, so I built everything from scratch.

SQL Database:
I used MySQL as the database for the application. I connected to MySQL using PHP's PDO extension and managed all database interactions (create, read, update, delete) via DAO classes. For database visualization and management, I utilized DBeaver.

Running the Project
Start the PHP Server:
To run the project, navigate to the project root in your terminal and run:

<br>
php -S localhost:8000
This command starts PHP’s built‑in server. You can then access the application at:

<br>
http://localhost:8000/frontend/src/html/index.html
Dynamically Loaded Content:
The SPA dynamically loads page content via AJAX. When a page (such as the overview) is loaded, the corresponding JavaScript functions fetch and render data from PHP endpoints. This includes full CRUD operations for tasks, all of which are managed using the DAO pattern.
